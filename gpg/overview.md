# Overview of GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)

GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) is a free, open-source implementation of the OpenPGP standard, which provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. GPG is widely used for encrypting files, emails, and verifying the authenticity of digital signatures.

## Key Features
- **Encryption & Decryption:** Securely encrypt and decrypt files or messages to protect sensitive information.
- **Digital Signatures:** Sign data and verify signatures to ensure authenticity and integrity.
- **Key Management:** Generate, import, export, and manage public and private keys.
- **Compatibility:** Interoperable with other OpenPGP-compliant software.

## Common Use Cases
- **Secure Email:** Encrypt and sign emails to ensure privacy and authenticity.
- **File Encryption:** Protect files at rest or in transit.
- **Software Distribution:** Sign software releases to verify their origin and integrity.

## Basic Commands
- Generate a new key pair:
  ```sh
  gpg --full-generate-key
  ```
- Encrypt a file:
  ```sh
  gpg -e -r recipient@example.com file.txt
  ```
- Decrypt a file:
  ```sh
  gpg -d file.txt.gpg
  ```
- Sign a file:
  ```sh
  gpg --sign file.txt
  ```
- Verify a signature:
  ```sh
  gpg --verify file.txt.gpg
  ```
